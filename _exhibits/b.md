February 7th

Read more of the novel, no work on the project. Proposal was submitted on the 6th.

**Week 12** 

March 28th

all photos have been collected, metadata record is due Thursday by the end of class. Antonio has started putting information together to be finished in class Thursday hoping more group members show up. Our question: What is the culture of Kirkwood and how does it ebb and flow throughout the week?                                

March 30th

Antonio submitted the metadata record. We had time to work as a group to discuss next steps. Jillina will write the “about” page before the website is created. 

**Week 13**

April 4th 
 
All photos and documents so far were compiled into a google drive that each member has access to. Moving forward, all other documents will also be put here. 

April 6th

We read and discussed the comments left on our metadata record and considered which changes we wanted to make based on the feedback. Decided to add a column for context/relevance. 


**Week 14** 

April 11th

We discussed details of the metadata record and made changes based on the comments that were left. 

April 13th

Started thinking about how we want to present the project to the class. Discussed due dates for the rest of the class and possible designs for the website. Group has learned from Yilin that Madison most likely has dropped the class due to nonresponsiveness and no feedback and the finalized group is set into 3 group members. 
Comments left by Yilin “The metadata is well formatted, a few suggestions for you to consider: 1 how to foreground the timeline as the organizing principle for your images (time of day? time of week?) 2 how to sort the images with object_type column 3 if there's little info about people, maybe that column can be absorbed into description? 4 What comments do you have for the images in addition to factual descriptions, would an extra comment column help bring out reasons that you have for choosing these images?” 
The way these comments were addressed by incorporating the information columns into the description. Moreover, another column was added for reasons why we chose the pictures we inputted into the metadata record, giving a response as to why. For the dates column we were inputting the time of day. To make the timeline more accurate and concrete. 


**Week 15**

April 18th

We watched a project be developed on Wax and created our own while following along. Yilin will run the tasks after class so we can complete the site. 

April 20th

Began writing the project descriptions on each of the website pages (Jillian) while Antonio finished perfecting/formatting. 

**Week 16** 

April 25th

Comments were left saying “Image files not in folder; metadata record needs a few updates.” Today, we made these changes to prepare to launch the site. Jillian worked on the about page. 

April 27th 

Finished our project, submitted a metadata record for the site to be published. Jillian added an exhibits and wrote about them
