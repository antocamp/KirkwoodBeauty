Exhibit A: Power of Protest

![obj5_2](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/131365205/234861286-f8e6a924-8068-40bf-b871-7ee0f4bdaa14.jpeg)



This photo, one of many demonstrations of political unrest, is critical to the culture of Kirkwood. This installation is placed on a wall that used to house many unhoused people, presenting a similar demonstration of unrest and inequality. "Black Lives Matter" is a statement brought to life in ~2020 during protests following instances of police brutality and gun violence. It stands for injustice and demands action and equality. Its placement on Kirkwood demands the message to be seen, heard, and discussed. It is ironic, however, that this call for justice is in a place known to house much of Bloomington's homeless population for some parts of the year. Bloomington is a melting pot for diverse cultures, beliefs, values, etc., but things like this bring undeniable inequalities to the surface and allow us to recognize them clearly. We have freedom of speech and freedom to protest, as demonstrated in the photo above, but does it make a difference in our community?
