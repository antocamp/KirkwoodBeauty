For this project, we asked a question of social observation. We wondered- what is the culture of Kirkwood and how does it ebb and flow with our society? The series of 20 photos collected responded to this question in several ways, depicting religion, arts, restaurants, and closed doors. Monday through Thursday, Kirkwood is seemingly monotonous. Restaurants close fairly early, leaving the streets lacking people but ridden with lights and store signs. The photos demonstrate a culture of acceptance as many cultures and values are depicted. Kirkwood is the hub of the University and of Bloomington as a whole, and we were comforted to view the symbols of tolerance and acceptance, silently embracing and encouraging diversity in our community every day. From the surface level, it seems insignificant. However, in our community full of diverse student backgrounds, religions, etc., it is inexplicably important to represent this variety to create a sense of belonging. Kirkwood sits right in front of the Sample Gates, the entrance to Indiana University's remarkable campus. It defines our culture before one even steps foot on the campus, further emphasizing the importance of its strong first impression. Our photos range from sidewalk art installations and religious expressions to restaurant canopies and street lights. The variety perfectly responds to our proposed question as it is this variety that allows the concrete streets and storefronts to seamlessly adapt to each person and scene.
