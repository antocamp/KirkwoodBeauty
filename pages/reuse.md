The photos and data within this collection can be reused to gain a better understanding and appreciation for Bloomington's sense of pop culture. While the pictures themselves tell a story, the data behind them can emphasize their distinct identities and intricacies. This data could be easily incorporated into larger collections that further analyze Bloomington's ever-changing culture. It may provide a strong foundation to better understand the ebbs and flows of our society. By adding more rows, more content could be described and included. If more columns were added to the metadata, the image data would be more specific and could be altered to describe a different scene or purpose.
