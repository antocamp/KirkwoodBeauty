This project was created by Jillian Campbell, the writer, Antonio Campos, the technologist, and Jardon Scheiber, the producer. Each member participated in photo collection on Kirkwood. Antonio handled the majority of the data interpretation, Jillian filled the website with image/collection descriptions, and Jardon completed everything in between. It was created to fulfill requirements for coursework in Introduction to Popular Culture.
